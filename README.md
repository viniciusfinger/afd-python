# Deterministic Finite Automaton in Python 游냀

Deterministic finite automaton simulator built in Python for the Formal Languages and Automata course at La Salle University.


## Running locally:

Clone the project:

```

Access the project folder:

```bash
  cd afd-python
```

Run the main file:

```bash
  python3 main.py
```

## How to use:

After running, just fill in the information requested by the console

You must insert the automaton states into this pattern, according to the number of states you need, following the pattern s{number of state}:

```bash
  s0 s1 s2 s3
```

Then, insert the alphabet characters into this pattern, however you want:

```bash
  a b c d
```

When asked to complete the sentence with the next state, you must enter next state for that value or a period (.) when there is no next state.

The number above the arrow is the value read by the tape, the state on the left is the current state and the state on the right (which you must fill in) is where it will go.

```bash
    0
s0 ---> (coloque o estado que ir치 quando estiver em s0 e a fita ler 0, ou ponto (.) caso n칚o haja transi칞칚o)
```

At the end, the program will request a word to be validated in the automaton.

Se for v치lida, printar치 "Palavra aceita pelo aut칪mato". Caso contr치rio, printar치 "Palavra rejeitada pelo aut칪mato".
